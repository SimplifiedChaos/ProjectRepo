# ProjectRepo
 Just a place where I store my projects, in-progress/abandoned
 
 
 Scheduling -
 A project where I was the primary programmer, along with a UI/Algorithm guy, and a website guy. Extremely proud of the way the code turned out, not so happy with the results of my team members parts of the project. Stress was artificially induced by giving us a very short timeframe(couple of weeks) while remote (covid-19) and having us partialled out to specific roles where we were not supposed to interfere with anyone else's work on the project. This was a test by the professor to see if we could form a coherent team with pre-defined roles. 
 We were also instructed to have a niche with our project, something that made it stand out agains the other projects by the other teams in the class. It had to be something that was off the wall, so we chose to develop a WebGL application in Unity hosted on a website while having Unity linked in to a database for multiple people to work on the program at the same time. This was a scheduler program, including a schedule viewer, algorithm to generate schedules, class and teacher adder to create teachers with timeframes and knowledges and classes with timeframes and knowledges required to teach it. The main hurdle was getting unity to connect with the database via PHP and mySQL, though Unity does have a built in WWW form system to allow for this. It was deprecated not long after the project was completed, so without going back to old unity versions, I do not believe it is possible to recreate it in the same fashion.
 
 
 VR Testing Try 4 -
 A quick project (developed in about 5~ hours) to show basic competency in a VR workspace. Includes gun physics, throwable/interactable items, snap attach to hand with raycast, yank items through the air via raycast, and a basic balloon spawner for interaction with the gun physics. Many more things to implement, but I feel it suffices for a quick demo to prove that I know how VR development functions. Contact me if there are any implementations that you wish to test me on, I'll be happy to figure out a solution and get back to you with it. 
 
 Assignment 5 Lab report -
 A report covering a circuit project that involved creating a simple computer with all of its constituent parts (mem, ram, CPU(ALU specifically) registers, etc) formed from basic circuits (all the way down to AND/OR gates). Report should explain most things about it, some of the simpler parts were detailed within past reports, but this will show the gist of the project.
 
 March2nd LinReg 1Var -
 A python project for linear regression with 1 variable created for an AI class. This was used in a later project not listed, so its functions are limited.
 
 March2nd LinReg MultiVar -
 Ditto ^. Multi variable instead. 
 
 Project 2 Naive Bayes -
 Naive Bayes algorithm, self explanatory
 
 Titanic -
 Common dataset used to test programmers' machine learning strengths. I used this dataset to test a multitude of different algos to see different correlations produced with the results. Comments should explain the rest within the code. 
 
 
 If there are any questions about any of these, feel free to contact me at tanderae@gmail.com. If there are any requests for explanations or to create a new project to show my understanding in a subject, also let me know. Thanks for reading! Enjoy perusing!
